kube-prometheus-manifest
This repository contains the manifests for deploying the kube-prometheus stack, which includes Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana, along with a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules. The manifests are based on the kube-prometheus project, which simplifies the process of deploying and configuring these monitoring tools on a Kubernetes cluster.

Folder Structure
kube-prometheus-crd/
The setup folder contains the necessary manifests and configuration files to prepare your Kubernetes cluster for deploying the kube-prometheus stack. This setup includes the creation of namespaces, service accounts, roles, and role bindings that the monitoring components need to function correctly.

Contents
0namespace-namespace.yaml: Creates the monitoring namespace where all the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana resources will be deployed.
0namespace-alertmanager.yaml: Creates the alertmanager namespace specifically for Alertmanager resources.
0namespace-prometheus.yaml: Creates the prometheus namespace for Prometheus-related resources.
0namespace-grafana.yaml: Creates the grafana namespace for Grafana resources.
prometheus-operator-serviceAccount.yaml: Defines the ServiceAccount for the Prometheus Operator.
prometheus-operator-clusterRole.yaml: Specifies the ClusterRole required by the Prometheus Operator to manage Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related resources.
prometheus-operator-clusterRoleBinding.yaml: Binds the Prometheus Operator's ServiceAccount to the ClusterRole, granting it the necessary permissions.
prometheus-operator-deployment.yaml: Deploys the Prometheus Operator to manage the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana components in your cluster.
Command to Apply the setup/ Folder
To apply the manifests in the setup folder and prepare your cluster for the kube-prometheus stack, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f setup/
This command will sequentially apply each manifest in the setup folder, ensuring that the necessary namespaces, service accounts, roles, and role bindings are in place before deploying the monitoring components.

Other Folders
Apart from the setup folder, the repository also contains additional folders with various manifests for deploying and configuring the kube-prometheus stack:

prometheus/: Contains manifests for deploying Prometheus instances, including Prometheus configuration, rules, and alerts.
alertmanager/: Includes manifests for deploying Alertmanager, which handles alerts generated by Prometheus.
grafana/: Contains manifests for deploying Grafana, a tool for visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.
node-exporter/: Deploys the Node Exporter, which collects hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels.
kube-state-metrics/: Includes manifests for deploying kube-state-metrics, which provides detailed insights into the state of the objects in a Kubernetes cluster.
prometheus-adapter/: Deploys the Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs, enabling custom metrics support.
blackbox-exporter/: Contains manifests for deploying the Blackbox Exporter, which probes endpoints over various protocols and provides metrics on the results.
Detailed Explanation of the Folder
The repository structure is designed to provide a modular approach to deploying a comprehensive monitoring stack on Kubernetes. By separating the setup, configuration, and deployment of each component (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, etc.), the repository allows for easier management, customization, and scaling of the monitoring stack.

Setup Folder Workflow
Namespace Creation: The setup folder first ensures that all required namespaces (monitoring, alertmanager, prometheus, grafana) are created.
RBAC Configuration: It sets up the required roles and role bindings to ensure that the Prometheus Operator has the necessary permissions to manage the monitoring components.
Service Account Creation: The necessary ServiceAccounts for the Prometheus Operator and related components are created.
Deployment of Prometheus Operator: Finally, the Prometheus Operator is deployed, which then manages the lifecycle of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.
This workflow is crucial as it ensures that the Kubernetes cluster is correctly configured before the actual monitoring components are deployed, reducing the likelihood of deployment failures and permission issues.

Conclusion
The kube-prometheus-manifest repository provides all the necessary manifests to deploy a complete monitoring stack on Kubernetes. The setup folder plays a critical role in preparing the cluster for this deployment by ensuring that the necessary namespaces, RBAC configurations, and the Prometheus Operator are correctly set up. Once the setup is complete, you can proceed with deploying the monitoring components using the remaining manifests in the repository.

This README.md should provide clear guidance on the purpose and usage of the folder, helping users understand how to deploy the monitoring stack successfully.
